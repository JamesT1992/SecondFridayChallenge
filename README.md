# SecondFridayChallenge

# What was the challenge?
The challenge was to clone down a repository containing a flask app, we were to put the flask app inside one container, and place an SQL database inside a second container that was part of the original flask app.

# How I expected the challenge to go.
The challenge went ok, at the time of writing these I don't think I managed to get the app to fully function, I got both of the apps running in containers but couldnt get the finished result to show up on the port.
NOTE - someone suggested adding them to a network to communicate so I did so, but I just got a different error when I ran them both on a network.

# What went well?
For the most part I understood the challenge, it was a matter of executing what was required of me that proved slightly problematic. My notes assisted me for the most part of writing the python dockerfile, although I had to ask my peers on how to install the extra python flask dependancies that I hadn't come across before.

# What didn't go as planned?
If I didn't have the tutorial video for the sql dockerfile and database I would have been really stuck. Understanding the python dockerfiles still needs some work, and the additional commands for the SQL dockerfiles were really tough to grasp for me this week.

# Possible improvements for future challenges.
I would try and develop a greater understanding of the commands inside the dockerfiles. Although I have all of their definition, I think I really need to hone in on my application of them. Although I feel I asked a good amount of questions this week, perhaps it is something I should have brought up that I needed explaining slightly more. (im sure it will come with practice).
